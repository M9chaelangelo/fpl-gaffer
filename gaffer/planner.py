"""Evaluate a plan you wrote yourself.

`optimise.plan` answers "what should I do". This module answers a different
question: "I have decided to do THIS — does it work, and what does it cost me
against the best line?"

The two are not the same job. A solver that only ever hands you its own answer
is impossible to argue with, and the README is right that an argument you
cannot have is one you cannot win. Most managers already hold a plan in their
head — wildcard after the international break, Bench Boost on the double. What
they lack is something that checks it against the rules and prices it.

Three things this does that the solver does not:

  VALIDATES. A plan that sprints past the budget in GW9 is worse than no plan,
  because you find out at 19:29 on a Friday. Every rule the game enforces is
  checked here, at the gameweek it breaks, and ALL breaks are reported — you
  want to know whether it is one mistake or five before you start fixing.

  PRICES THE GAP. Your plan against the solver's, in points, so "Bench Boost in
  GW9 instead of GW7" stops being a matter of taste and becomes a number.

  SURVIVES A BREAK. Evaluation continues past a violation so the rest of the
  plan can still be read. `legal` is False and the numbers are then indicative,
  not real.

Everything here is a pure function of `proj` and the plan. No network, no
solver, no global state — which is why it can be tested, and is.
