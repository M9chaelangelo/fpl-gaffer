"""The part that gets smarter over time.

Three models, each answering a question the optimiser cannot answer on its own:

  minutes  — will he actually play 60+? The single largest driver of points,
             and the thing a naive projection gets most wrong.
  price    — will he rise or fall tonight? Drives when to move, and how much
             budget the wildcard will have.
  points   — how many points, given expected minutes, xGI, defensive rate and
             fixture? Trained on outcomes rather than assumed from a prior.

Run `python -m gaffer.learn` to (re)train. Models are cached in models/ and
picked up automatically by projections.py on the next solve.
