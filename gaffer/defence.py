"""Clean sheets, goals conceded and saves — modelled, not guessed.

Attacking returns are lumpy and hard to predict. Defensive returns are the
opposite: they are close to a Poisson process driven by two numbers, how many
goals a team concedes and how good the opponent's attack is. That makes them the
most forecastable points in the game, and the reason a cheap defender on a good
run is often better value than a mid-price midfielder.

Everything below is built from expected goals conceded rather than fixture
difficulty ratings, then calibrated against Solio's published match odds for the
teams it covers.
