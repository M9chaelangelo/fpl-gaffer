"""Which CBC to hand a model to.

PuLP 3.3 deprecated both halves of how this project talked to it, and PuLP 4.0
removes them. One half is a rename: `LpVariable(name, cat=...)` becomes
`prob.add_variable(name, cat=...)`, which 3.3 already understands, so the call
sites just use the new form and this module has nothing to say about it.

The other half is not a rename, and that is why this file exists.
`PULP_CBC_CMD` ran a CBC binary that shipped inside the wheel. `COIN_CMD` runs
whatever `cbc` is on PATH and has nothing to fall back on — under PuLP 4 the
binary is a separate install (`pulp[cbc]`, which is in `requirements.txt` for
exactly this reason). Swapping one name for the other blind would trade a
TypeError for a solver that quietly finds no answer, and an unsolved model
looks precisely like an unsolvable one: the wildcard drafter raises "no legal
squad for 100.0m" either way. A crash is honest; that is not.

So ask which of them can actually reach a binary, newest first.

`LpStatus` went the same way, and it is the same trap in miniature: the
wildcard drafter decides whether it trusts a squad by comparing the status to
the word "Optimal". A status that arrives as `1`, or as an enum, silently
fails that comparison and a perfectly good rebuild is reported as one the
solver could not confirm. So the status becomes a word here, once.
