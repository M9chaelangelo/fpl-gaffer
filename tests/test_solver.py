"""The solver has to exist before the model is worth writing.

PuLP 4.0 removed both halves of how this project talked to it. The variable
constructor was a rename and the call sites moved. The solver was not: the CBC
that used to ship inside the wheel now has to be installed separately, and the
replacement class has nothing to fall back on when it isn't.

That is the failure worth a test. A missing solver does not raise — it returns
no answer, and the wildcard drafter then reports "no legal squad for 100.0m",
which reads exactly like a budget that doesn't work. A dependency change would
arrive disguised as a football problem.
